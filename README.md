# dropdown_menu

When opening index.html in Chrome or Firefox, the page should initially show the
menu colored pink with National parks, Tahoe, Death Valley, Yosemite.

When the mouse is hovered over Yosemite, a sub menu should show up with campgrounds
Curry Village, Redbud, North Pines. The sub menu should have background color violet.

When the mouse is hover over North Pines, another sub menu should show up with campsites 101, 137, 209.  This inner sub menu should have light
green background color.

When the user clicks on any menu item, whether it be Park #, Campground #, or Campsite #,
then a javascript alert box should appear with the content of that alert window
being the name of the menu item (ie: "Death Valley", "Redbud", "137", etc).
